# ARTI
Are you wondering how much time does it take to read your speech? Or when you'll finish to read that boaring assignment your teacher gave you last week? NO WORRIES! ARTI kicks in to give you a hand. You just have to insert the path of your file (PDF, TXT or DOCX only) aand ... BOOM the reading time will appeare, as magical as an unicorn ðŸ¦„.
And yea, if you were wondering, ARTI stands for (ar = r)eading(ti = t)ime.
!Python 3 needed!
